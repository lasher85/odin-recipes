<h3>Pizza Ingredients</h3>

<p>You need just five ingredients (plus some warm water) to make this super simple pizza crust.</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Yeast:</strong>Active dry yeast is a leavening agent, which means it's the ingredient that causes the
        pizza dough to rise.</li>
    <li><strong>Sugar:</strong>To activate your yeast, you'll need to dissolve it in warm water with a teaspoon of
        sugar. The sugar gives the yeast something to eat and speeds up the activation process. You'll know your yeast
        is active when it becomes bubbly and frothy on top.</li>
    <li><strong>Bread Flour</strong>Bread flour is ideal for pizza crust becauseit creates chewier results than
        all-purpose flour. This is because it contains more protein, which helps produce lots of gluten. Gluten is what
        gives the crust elasticity.</li>
    <li><strong>Olive Oil:</strong>Olive oil serves a couple purposes when it comes to pizza crust: Not only does it add
        color and flavor, but it creates a barrier between the oil and water. This oily barrier prevents sogginess.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Salt:</strong>A little bit of salt goes a long way. Salt adds flavor, strengthens the gluten (creating a
        chewier crust), and slows down fermentation (resulting in a better rise).</li>
</ul>
